# Overview

We are participating in [Wormhole SIGMA Sprint](https://sigma.wormhole.com/sprint) with this project.

This project implements a mechanism for depositing USDC directly from chains like Ethereum to Windfall on Solana, utilizing the following components / technologies:

- Wormhole TS SDK
- Circle CCTP USDC Transfer
- Circle Web3 Services (dev-controlled Programmable Wallet)

End users can deposit USDC into the Windfall `vault` program deployed on Solana and access services provided by Windfall by simply signing Ethereum transactions.

Note that as long as bridging to Solana is available, tokens other than USDC can be supported, and thanks to Wormhole, various source chains can be supported for bridging, not limited to EVM chains.

The main goal of Windfall is to promote onboarding to Web3, especially Solana, through gamification, and cross-chain deposits play a crucial role in this mission.

Here's how to use the frontend and understand the general flow of operations:

- The end user connects to an EVM-compatible wallet *A* (we used Brave Wallet for testing)
- The backend creates a Circle Programmable Wallet *X* on Solana that is linked to wallet *A*
- When a user initiates a deposit:
  - Wallet *A* signs an EVM-side USDC transfer transaction to start cross-chain bridging
  - The system waits for Circle Attestation
  - Programmable Wallet *X* signs a Solana-side token receive transaction
  - Programmable Wallet *X* signs a Solana-side Windfall deposit transaction
- When a user initiates a withdrawal:
  - The end user connects their EVM-compatible wallet *A*
  - The backend looks up the Circle Programmable Wallet *X* on Solana that is linked to wallet *A*
  - Programmable Wallet *X* signs a Solana-side Windfall withdrawal transaction
  - Programmable Wallet *X* signs a Solana-side USDC transfer transaction
  - The system waits for Circle Attestation
  - Wallet *A* signs an EVM-side USDC receive transaction

Please refer to the [sequence diagrams at the end of this README](#diagrams) for more details.

We plan to integrate and replace (some part of) this architecture with [Wormhole Composable Intents Swap](https://wormhole.com/blog/wormhole-launches-era3-adding-intents-protocol-and-major-user-experience) once it becomes available.

In Windfall, users receive points based on various factors such as the amount deposited and the number of new users acquired through referrals.
Based on these points, users can participate in on-chain lottery draws to receive reward distributions.

As such, while this project focuses on facilitating cross-chain deposits and is not currently integrated into the Windfall portal, integration should be straightforward since points can be awarded by periodically taking snapshots of the Solana accounts created during deposits regardless of the source of deposited funds.

# Demonstration

The demo frontend is deployed at a temporary domain [https://test.softgate.co.jp/](https://test.softgate.co.jp/).

![Demo Site](Frontend.png)

You can use this demonstration site to evaluate the project and observe how it works.
For instructions on using this site, please refer to the demo video submitted for the hackathon.

Due to operating on devnet, deposit and withdrawal processes take a relatively long time.
Therefore, you may want to check the console output in your browsers developer tools to see what is going on in the background.

The backend API server is deployed at [https://api.softgate.co.jp/sigma](https://api.softgate.co.jp/sigma).
The demo frontend mentioned above is configured to work with this backend API server.

The system operates on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and Solana devnet.
To perform bridge operations, you will need ETH and USDC on the Sepolia testnet.

You can obtain testnet ETH and USDC through the following faucet services (among others) <a id="faucets">:</a>

- [Google Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) (ETH)
- [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia) (ETH)
- [Circle Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) (USDC)

You must also have a compatible wallet installed in your browser that is configured to interact with the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.
This application requires a wallet capable of signing transactions without broadcasting them to the network.
We used the Brave Wallet during development.
We have not verified compatibility with other wallets, and MetaMask is *not* supported due to transaction signing limitations at this time.

# Directory structure

The `frontend` directory contains all the source code for the web application intended for end users. If you want to try out this project yourself, this is the application you'll need to run.

The `api` directory contains the source code for the backend API server. Since the backend requires Circle Web3 Services API keys and other configurations, we recommend using the test server provided by Windfall.

The `program` directory contains the source code for a Solana program called `vault`.
While the `vault` program was copied from another repository and therefore doesn't have much commit history here, development of the `vault` program in the other repository began after the SIGMA Sprint period started, as shown in the figure below.

# How to build

## Frontend

Create `frontend/.env` file and specify settings like this:

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS = true
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT = http://localhost:3010
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT` points to the HTTP API server described in the next section below.
If you want to use the API server provided by Windfall for demonstration purposes, specify `https://api.softgate.co.jp/sigma`.

To start the frontend, first navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required packages:

```shell
npm install
```
Then run the local HTTP server with the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

After that, you can access the application by opening `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

If you need testnet ETH and USDC, you can obtain them through the faucet services [listed above](#faucets).

## Backend (API Server)

Backend is an HTTP API server program that handles interactions with Circle Web3 Services and Windfall's `vault` program on Solana.

First, you need to sign up for Circle Web3 Services and obtain your API key, entity secret, and a wallet set.

Then create `api/.env.development.local` and provide your Circle API-related configurations:

```shell
CIRCLE_API_KEY = <YOUR_CIRCLE_TESTNET_API_KEY>
CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET = <YOUR_CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET>
CIRCLE_WALLET_SET_ID = <YOUR_CIRCLE_WALLET_SET_ID>
```

Edit `api/.env` to specify the port (otherwise defaults to 3000), blockchain (SOL or SOL-DEVNET), private key for a Solana account that temporarily covers transaction fees, and Solana RPC endpoint. These settings are for the HTTP API server and are not exposed externally.

```shell
PORT = 3010
BLOCKCHAIN = SOL-DEVNET
SOL_PAYER = [123,56,...,78,90]
RPC_ENDPOINT = <YOUR_RPC_ENDPOINT>
TOKEN_MINT = <DEPOSIT_TOKEN_MINT_PUBKEY>
VAULT_TYPE = <VAULT_TYPE_PUBKEY>
```

For devnet, you can use the following settings in `.env` and use the existing vault type which works with devnet USDC:

```shell
TOKEN_MINT = 4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU
VAULT_TYPE = 2zHQowNu91LJrfaWfpNDMxFXr6DxNYXksYV24UbhBwRX
```

The account specified by the private key in `SOL_PAYER` needs to hold a small amount of SOL to cover transaction fees.
For Solana Devnet, assuming you have Solana CLI installed, you can obtain SOL using the following command:

```shell
solana airdrop 5 <SOL_PAYER_PUBKEY_OR_SOL_PAYER_KEYFILE_PATH>
```

## Solana Program

```shell
anchor keys sync
anchor build
anchor test
```

As of this writing, the `vault` program is deployed on Solana devnet at `DcnDr4dPpXWHkmS8TSXG3bL9dnshCVRRzQi4gTndtUsG`.
It is recommended to use the deployed program as is in most cases.

## Deposit

When making a deposit, the following sequence of operations is executed.
Most of these are handled internally, and the end user only needs to:

- Specify the USDC token amount and click the "Deposit USDC" button
- Sign the bridge transactions with their Ethereum wallet

![Deposit](Deposit-Sequence.png)

## Withdrawal

Similarly, the withdrawal process is streamlined to minimize user operations:

- Specify the USDC token amount and click the "Withdraw USDC" button
- Sign the receipt transaction with their Ethereum wallet
